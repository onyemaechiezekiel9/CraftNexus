/// # Integration notes — issue #497 / component #96
///
/// ## Purpose
/// All username storage keys and uniqueness checks operate on the
/// *normalized* form produced by this function. Clients and indexers
/// must apply the same normalization before constructing lookup keys or
/// comparing usernames.
///
/// ## Normalization rules (applied in order)
/// 1. ASCII alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) are kept and
///    lowercased.
/// 2. Separator characters (space ` `, underscore `_`, hyphen `-`,
///    period `.`) are collapsed to a single `_`. Consecutive separators
///    produce exactly one `_`; leading and trailing separators are
///    stripped.
/// 3. A subset of Latin-extended and Cyrillic Unicode code points are
///    transliterated to their closest ASCII equivalents via
///    `map_username_bytes` (e.g. `ä` → `a`, `ß` → `ss`). Zero-width
///    joiners and BOM sequences are silently dropped.
/// 4. Any other byte sequence that is not matched by the above rules is
///    replaced with a single `_` separator (subject to the collapsing
///    rule in step 2).
/// 5. The result is always lowercase ASCII.
///
/// ## Input constraints
/// - Maximum input length: 256 bytes. Inputs exceeding this limit cause
///   a panic; callers should validate length before invoking.
/// - The function does **not** enforce minimum or maximum username
///   length — that is the responsibility of the calling function
///   (`onboard_user`, `change_username`) using the configured
///   `min_username_length` / `max_username_length` values.
///
/// ## Storage side-effects
/// - None. This is a pure transformation with no persistent reads or
///   writes.
///
/// ## Off-chain consumers
/// - Apply the same rules client-side before calling `is_username_taken`
///   or `get_user_by_username` to avoid false negatives caused by
///   un-normalized input.
/// - The `UserOnboarded` and `UsernameChanged` events carry the
///   already-normalized username; use those values verbatim for display
///   and reverse lookups.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `env` - Soroban environment reference
/// * `username` - Raw username string provided by the caller
///
/// # Returns
/// Normalized username as a `soroban_sdk::String` (lowercase ASCII,
/// separators collapsed, no leading/trailing `_`).

///
/// Clients and indexers that need to predict the on-chain canonical username

///   and `consumed` is the number of input bytes the matched character
///   occupied (so the caller can advance its cursor).
/// - `None` — the leading character has no transliteration rule; the caller

    /// ## Overview
    /// The onboarding contract provides a unified interface for managing user profiles,
    /// role assignments, and verification workflows on the CraftNexus platform.
    ///
    /// ## Core Structures
    ///
    /// ### UserProfile
    /// - **Purpose**: Represents a user's complete onboarding state
    /// - **Preconditions**: Must be initialized via `onboard_user` before access
    /// - **Storage**: Persistent key `DataKey::UserProfile(address)` with TTL auto-refresh
    /// - **Events Emitted**: `UserOnboardedEvent`, `RoleUpdated`, `PortfolioUpdated`
    ///
    /// ### OnboardingConfig
    /// - **Purpose**: System-wide settings for verification, username constraints
    /// - **Preconditions**: Must be initialized before any user operations
    /// - **Storage**: Singleton `DataKey::Config` with extended TTL for stability
    /// - **Modifiable By**: Platform admin only
    ///
    /// ### UserMetrics
    /// - **Purpose**: Tracks escrow volume and count for auto-verification eligibility
    /// - **Preconditions**: Populated only by escrow contract via `update_user_metrics`
    /// - **Storage**: `DataKey::UserMetrics(address)` updated asynchronously
    /// - **Side-Effects**: Auto-verification triggers when thresholds met
    ///
    /// ## API Parameters & Validation
    ///
    /// ### Username Constraints (Component #84)
    /// - **Format**: Normalized to lowercase, UTF-8 canonical form
    /// - **Length**: 3-50 characters after normalization
    /// - **Uniqueness**: Case-insensitive across all users (enforced via `DataKey::Username`)
    /// - **Reserved Names**: "admin" and derivations permanently reserved
    /// - **Change Cooldown**: 30 days between successive changes (prevents abuse)
    ///
    /// ### Role Transitions (Endpoint #85)
    /// - **Valid Roles**: Buyer, Artisan, Moderator (None and Admin excluded)
    /// - **Authorization**: Platform admin only; enforced via `require_auth()`
    /// - **Audit Trail**: All transitions logged to `VerificationHistoryIndexed`
    /// - **Event Emission**: `RoleUpdated` carries (user, old_role, new_role)
    ///
    /// ### Verification Workflow
    /// - **Auto-Verification**: Triggered when metrics meet thresholds (configurable)
    /// - **Manual Requests**: Queued in FIFO order via `VerificationQueueHead/Tail`
    /// - **History**: Last 10 entries retained per user (compact indexed format #519)
    /// - **State Machine**: none → requested → {approved|rejected} → verified
    ///
    /// ## Storage Optimization (Issue #82)
    /// - **Compact Types**: Uses `symbol_short` and flat `CompactVerificationEntry`
    /// - **TTL Strategy**: Entries extended only on active reads to conserve rent
    /// - **Lazy Migration**: Legacy Vec entries converted to indexed on first access
    /// - **Rent Calculation**: ~600 stroops/ledger for typical profile (28 bytes)
    ///
    /// ## Check-Effect-Interactions Pattern (Security)
    /// All state-mutating endpoints follow strict ordering:
    /// 1. **Check**: Validate authorization, preconditions, constraints
    /// 2. **Effect**: Update persistent storage, emit events
    /// 3. **Interact**: External token transfers (e.g., username change fees) LAST
    ///
    /// This prevents reentrancy where malicious callers trigger intermediate states
    /// via callbacks on arbitrary token contracts before final balance settlement.
